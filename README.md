# VideoProcessing
Task- determination of the presence of moving objects in the video stream and their sketching in one color.
Develop a program that detects motion in a video stream. It is required to access the video stream and receive the next frames from it. Obtain motion zones in the video stream and correctly determine the type of motion in the stream. A written workable program must process at least two frames per second.
